# SQL Project
### Airline Database

- AirlineDB is a robust relational database designed to model and manage the end-to-end operations of an airline booking system. 
- It captures the lifecycle of a passenger’s journey—from booking and ticketing to flight segments, check-in, and seat allocation—while integrating aircraft configurations and airport metadata.
- The schema is optimized for operational integrity, analytical flexibility, and scalability across multiple travel scenarios including round trips, connecting flights, and multi-passenger bookings.

### Objectives

- Centralize all booking, ticketing, and flight data into a unified schema.

- Track passenger journeys across multiple flight segments.

- Ensure seat assignment integrity and prevent double bookings.

- Support aircraft-specific seat configurations and fare conditions.

- Enable rich analytics for revenue, occupancy, airport traffic, and aircraft utilization.
